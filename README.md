# Each Agent has it's own internal map state (Implemented)

This project considers the collaborative planning of routes for forest surveillance in accordance with risk of fire occurrence. The environment can be model as a heat map with probabilities of fire risk changing along time. A set of drones (UAVs) should be able to autonomously establish efforts to cover areas with higher risk of fire in accordance with a specific utility function.
The project can be further extended to comprise coordinated behavior in the presence of additional constraints.
